# ParrotApplication

Welcome to my ParrotApplication. This is an application that is using ASP.NET Core and written using C# and was done as part of an assignment in IT Step Academy. In this application you can upload links with videos for your favourite internet famous parrot. Functionalities were added to be able to add, edit and remove entries of the parrots and their videos in the database, as well as use different types of sorting. The included initial migration contains some entries as well.

Thank you for reading so far and enjoy some cute parrots!
